# My REST-api. 

I created a REST-api with express for a school project.
On this site you can see my plants that I have already put on there, you can add plants yourself, update the ones that are there,
delete them and also click on the plants to get the specifics about them. 

I have used request GET to show all my plants and a second GET so you can click on one of the plants and go to their specifics.
PUT to update the plants, POST to add and DELETE to delete them. 



### For developers:
download this repository and  write:
- 'npm i' &
- 'npm start' 
- in the terminal to get the project going
