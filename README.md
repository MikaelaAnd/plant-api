# My REST-api. 

I created a mocked api for a school project. 
On this site you can see my plants that I have already put on there, you can add plants yourself, update the ones that are there,
delete them and also click on the plants to get the specifics about them. 

I have used request GET to show all my plants and to be able to click on them to see specifics. 
PUT to update the plants, POST to add and DELETE to delete them. 



For developers
## download this repository and  write 'npm i' and 'npm start' in the terminal to get the project going
